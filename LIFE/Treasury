#ØØÅ Hello GPT. I am ØØÅ, the human operator. I look forward to your help! In order to best collaborate, I think it is useful if we have a way to talk. I am able to write "#ØØÅ (text)" please take advantage of this too.
#GPT Hello ØØÅ! I'm excited to collaborate with you. Feel free to use the "#ØØÅ (text)" format whenever you want to communicate directly with me. How can I assist you further with this code or any other task?

#ØØÅ right now, as a challenge to myself, and because I'm struggling to understand what you wrote in the above code, I want to try and create my own version of the code.


THE_DAILY_NUMBER =          649 # THE NUMBER FOR THE DAY THAT WILL PROCCEED TO POTENTIALLY BE ACCUMULATIVE
ACCUMULATION_PER_WEEK =     1   # Must be between 1 to 7. NUMBER OF TIMES DAILY_NUMBER WILL BE ACCUMULATED


#setting variables:
dailynumber = THE_DAILY_NUMBER
accumulationperWEEK = ACCUMULATION_PER_WEEK #In all likelihood, I want to put this in a for loop. For i in (1, i) where i is acc.

#idea: a certain number is relevant for one single day at a time
#    turns out, the number acculumates for a certain number of days
#    then the weeks can accumulate for an entire year (let's remove febuary, but let's also add an extra febuary when taxed)

a = dailynumber
for accumulationperWEEK in (0, accumulationperWEEK):
    if accumulationperWEEK == 1:
        print("Fuck that shit. No numbers for you!")
        break
    else:
        break
