#ØØÅ Hello GPT. I am ØØÅ, the human operator. I look forward to your help! In order to best collaborate, I think it is useful if we have a way to talk. I am able to write "#ØØÅ (text)" please take advantage of this too.
#GPT Hello ØØÅ! I'm excited to collaborate with you. Feel free to use the "#ØØÅ (text)" format whenever you want to communicate directly with me. How can I assist you further with this code or any other task?

#ØØÅ right now, as a challenge to myself, and because I'm struggling to understand what you wrote in the above code, I want to try and create my own version of the code.

ACCUMULATION_PER_WEEK =     4   # Must be between 1 to 7. NUMBER OF TIMES DAILY_NUMBER WILL BE ACCUMULATED


#setting variables:
dailynumber = THE_DAILY_NUMBER
accumulationperWEEK = ACCUMULATION_PER_WEEK #In all likelihood, I want to put this in a for loop. For i in (1, i) where i is acc.

#idea: a certain number is relevant for one single day at a time
#    turns out, the number acculumates for a certain number of days
#    then the weeks can accumulate for an entire year (let's remove febuary, but let's also add an extra febuary when taxed)

# The value for months when making budget: 30.5 - 0.5, and we don't count the 29 day month. In fact, we decided the 29 day month was 29 and not 28 in order to prep it for the second value.               30 times 11
# The value  for months when reporting budget: 30.5 + 0.5 (note, changed to 30.5 - 0.5, like Budgetmonths), and we count the 29 day month.                                                  This shows value of days (REPORTING) :  30 times 11  +  29 times 2
