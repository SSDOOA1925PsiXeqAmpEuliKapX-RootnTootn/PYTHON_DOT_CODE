# How easy is it to create a graph or an image that shows the unit circle, with a few lines with the coordinates of the most common angles marked on it?
# Answer: (I saw your answer)
#Thank you, but I meant how many lines of code, and can you generate it right now?
# Answer: Sure! Here is a simple example of how to create a unit circle with marked angles using Python and the Matplotlib library. This code will generate a graph showing the unit circle and the coordinates of common angles.

# Due to issue mentioned, the code has been removed and replaced with the corrected version below.

# This code will create a unit circle and mark the angles in radians around it. You can run this code in a Python environment with Matplotlib and NumPy installed to see the graph.
# The code is successfull. Good.
# Problem: I wanted to see real values, as in square roots and fractions and stuff, also, I was hoping to see the angles.
# Answer: Understood! Here is an updated version of the code that includes the exact values (like square roots and fractions) for the common angles on the unit circle.

# Code has been updated below.

# This code will create a unit circle and mark the angles in radians along with their exact coordinate values. You can run this code in a Python environment with Matplotlib and NumPy installed to see the graph.

# Perfect! Now, I was hoping to focus on the upper right quadrant, and to see the angles as well as the coordinates.
# Answer: Certainly! Below is a modified version of the code that focuses on the upper right quadrant of the unit circle, displaying both the angles in radians and their corresponding coordinates.

# Code has been updated below.

# This code will create a graph focusing on the upper right quadrant of the unit circle, marking the angles in radians along with their exact coordinate values. You can run this code in a Python environment with Matplotlib and NumPy installed to see the graph.
# Can we see the angles in real radians, not decial approximations?
# Answer: Certainly! Below is the modified code that displays the angles in real radians (using π notation) along with their corresponding coordinates in the upper right quadrant of the unit circle.

# Code has been updated below.

# This code will create a graph focusing on the upper right quadrant of the unit circle, marking the angles in radians using π notation along with their exact coordinate values. You can run this code in a Python environment with Matplotlib and NumPy installed to see the graph.

# It still shows decimal approximations for the angles. Can you fix that?
# Answer: Apologies for the oversight. Below is the corrected code that ensures the angles are displayed in exact radians (using π notation) without decimal approximations.
