# A numberline is arithmetic if the difference between one link and the link in front is constant.
def f(NRL_Arithmetic)
    a_n - 'a_n-1' = d
# Link number n is given by
a_n = a_1 + (n-1) * d 

# It's a geometric numberline if the relationship between one link and the link in front is constant.

# Link number n is given by 

# The above code isn't really executable. I do not have the coding skills to do that by myself, so here I will need to be told both what tools to use, and what those tools mean, and then maybe I'll be able to use it.
# I don't know what code task I should attempt to perform in order to prove that I know what I've learned in "Kapittel 3, følger og rekker" of the book "Mønster R2, by Tove Kalvø, Jens Christian Lothe Opdahl, Knut Skrindo, Øystein Johannes Weider. I'm mentioning that since it's hopefully a part of your training data, that way you'll hopefully know what is actually in chapter 3. No need to mention it, it's just that this project can go any kind of way so It'd be nice if we sticked to what was most relevant and good.

# Note: This is important too: Sn = (A1 + An)/(2) * n and Sn = A1 * (k^n - 1)/(k-1). Gotta work on those too.

# Update! Turns out teacher gives a killer good mission to figure out how this crap works. This is the task: You put money in the bank with rents, right? Well say you deposit the same each year, how will things be after a set amount of years? Like 10? What if after the sixth deposit the rent magically increases by a small bit?
